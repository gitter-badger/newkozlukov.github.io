<p>I cannot identify myself as a communist
for I’m yet to comprehend what fundamental ideas
of communism are.
Here I will try to.</p>

<hr />

<p>When it comes to attempts to define or describe “communism”,
regular people usually mention
social ownership, elimination of money.
Less often they would say about elimination of state.
A savvy person would also describe it as a classless society
(whatever that means).</p>

<p>I’d like to ask You, my friend: do all these demands feel… motivated?
Not to me. Not without thorough justification.</p>
