##  Background

It's January 25, 2018 as I'm writing this little essay.
A few days ago a terrible news struck the Russian students.
Some mental kid (Artyom, BMSTU) had in cold blood strangled to death, stabbed
and raped his girl roommate (Tanya, HSE). He had moreover written a detailed
description of the process and [published it
online](https://web.archive.org/web/20180123204415/http://telegra.ph/Istoriya-Artyoma-18-01-23).

It is a nasty case and the only thing nastier is that these things feel normal
in this country. But what is more interesting is the response of the public.
Just as one would expect there happend to be quite a lot of people who having
discovered that the slain girl wasn't an innocent angel have put the blame on
her:
she used to drink,
she posted erotic pics online,
she'd been demonstratively ignoring Artyom who loved her,
she'd repeatedly provoked him,
and so on.
This opinion had in many ways been expressed on the web
and was later picked up by the toxic jerks of Russian TV.
I hope I don't need to say that it's a bullshit.

##  The principle

Now back to the point. This happening reminded me of some idea.
See our two poor heros were having an affair.
They'd been together for some time, they'd split up, and yet they'd lived
together after that. And all this time they'd been in a constant fight,
expressing disdain of, pinning, and punching one another.
And you know what? It sounds nice and sweet if you remove the finale (although
some might appreciate the whole play). It sounds lively.

Think of it. Had we prohibited all offence what a world we'd live in?
Basically our every action can be considered by someone as offensive.
For instance when you hook up with a new person --- you're breaking into their
live. Just consider this situation:
you're lost in an unfamiliar country, you've got no home, you've got no money,
you don't speak the local language, and there isn't a soul out there to help
you. Suddenly you encounter a man speaking english on the phone. The man's
evidently in a great hurry (for some life-or-death meeting in a different town;
he's been heading towards the train station actually; you aren't aware of any of
that though).
You approach the man and ask him for help (for money, directions, oversleep).
But this way you impose a great amount of new responsibilities on him which he
never wanted. He doesn't have to help you but if he denies you that'd make him
ill-feeling for now he knows about your situation. It could also have turned out
that the man's willing to help. But he's late and he won't be able to come back
and help you in time. He has to choose now between his trouble and yours.
And here are a few questions in relation to this thought situation:

-   Did you have the right to approach the man?
-   Does the man have the right to reject?

If we are to prohibit an offence, we're to prohibit any kind of interaction
between people. It's a dead end just like absolute metaphysical skepticism.
As an answer to the two questions above I'd propose the following thesis:

> It is an essential human's right to offend and be offended.

As for defining an appropriate behaviour I'd seek for some variational principle
rather than for strict'n'rigid boundary conditions.

##  Conclusion

Had Tanya been "provoking"? Her Instagramm says so. And hell she had right to!
Did Artyom have right to feel offended? Why, yes! And it's perfectly fine! The
only problem here is that unfortunately Artyom broke. I can totally see why he
did and I'm sorry for both of them. Now what could've prevented him breaking? I
say a healthy society! But in the post-soviet Russia you've only got a toxic
hypocrite filth. I stop now and say no more.
